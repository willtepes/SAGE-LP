# SAGE-LP
Third grade learning platform demo built as solo project in Python/Django/Materialize
Solo project built over 4 days.  Allows Teacher accounts to set the question of the day (that all students see first when logging in) and see 
progress/time taken for all students as well as the average.  Students earn two stars for every correct answer and clicking the stumped? button will
let them know if any other students are working on the same question.  If any student is sufficiently ahead of the average they will see additional 
questions so that they will not become bored and disrupt the class.  All questions are actual 3rd grade SAGE (Special Approach to Gifted Learning)
problems.

Current Teacher login is teacher/12345678.  http://54.202.78.150/
